### how to run

run spring boot app with gradle wrapper

#### Unix or Mac
```shell 
./gradlew bootRun
```

#### Windows
```shell 
gradlew bootRun
```

This will create a single user, and a dummy recipe. Sign in with using the following details:

```shell
user: testuser
password: test
```

This is configured in class `WebSecurityConfig` class.

Search for 'Dummy' recipe, from `http://localhost:8080` (in the web browser)

### Create Recipes

1. head to `http://localhost:8080/view/recipe/create`

### Edit recipe with ID
1. You can edit recipe if you know the recipe id from `http://localhost:8080/view/recipe/edit/{recipeId}` (replace {recipeId} with valid integer id for the recipe)

### Preloaded recipes
Recipes are already loaded in `recipe-list.json`. You add any number of recipes to the file and the application will load them at startup.
